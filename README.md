This app uses data on motor vehicle collisions from the  NYC OpenData Website, and allows the user to subset it by 
borough, date, and whether there were any injuries. 
The app calculates the total number of accidents selected, and the average number per day.
It also shows a histogram of the time of day that the accidents occurred, and a bar chart of the top ten causes of injury accidents. 
Scrolling down, there is a summary of the dataset for the active parameter selections.
